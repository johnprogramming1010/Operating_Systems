QUESTION:
How does an interrupt differ from a trap?

A trap is a signal raised by a user program instructing the operating system to perform some functionality.
An interrupt is a signal to the CPU emitted by hardware that indicates an event that requires immediate attention.

GIVEN ANSWER:
A trap is a special form of interrupt that is generated by software while executing, either by an error or to request from the OS. 
Interrupts, other than traps, are generated by hardware, either external or internal circutrity.

QUESTION:
Would it be possible for the user to develope a new command interpreter using the system-call interface provided by the OS? Explain.

GIVEN ANSWER:
Yes, the user can use the system-call interface to invoke system-calls to implement a new command or modified version of existing command in the new interpreter,
provided the commmand interpreter need not be tightly integrated to the kernel.

QUESTION:
What are some of the advantages of loadable kernel modules?
Functionality can be added to and removed from the kernel while it is running, resulting in having no need to recompile or reboot the kernel.

GIVEN ANSWER:
LKMs allow the OS's base kernel to be flexible in functionaility and size by supporting an in-demand loading of kernel functions.
LKMs allow supporting new hardware and system calls.
LKMs allow better memory management by off-loading the modules supporting the functions that are not needed fro the memory, thereby reducing memory wastage.
LKMs allow flexibility and improved way of designing of an OS.
